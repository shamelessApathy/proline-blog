# Attribution for WordPress

**Attribution for WordPress** is a WordPress plugin for [Attribution](https://attributionapp.com).



## Debugging

Running into notices, warnings or errors?  Enable `WP_DEBUG` for proper error reporting by adding the following code to your `wp-config.php` file:

```
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
```

## Deploying

To deploy a new version of the WordPress plugin to the Plugins Directory, use the `make deploy` command which will ask which existing Git tag you want to deploy. You'll need to get credentials for the Attribution SVN repository.

_Note: this is for internal Attribution use only, and if you're just pull requesting things to the plugin you don't need to worry about this._
