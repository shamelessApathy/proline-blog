Attribution uses precise methods to calculate the ROI from your online ads.

Attribution diligently tracks every touchpoint each visitor makes before a purchase is made.

We automatically track Organic and Social traffic broken down into categories for each search engine and social network.

When Google and Facebook are connected we pull in your campaigns and automatically tag your your Facebook ad URLs so we can see which ad each customer came from.

Attribution allows you to define custom traffic sources by URL path, referrer, or any combination of UTM tags or URL params.

When a purchase is made, we divide credit between each touchpoint that influenced the purchase decision.

We divide credit based on the attribution model you choose: time decay, linear, first touch, or last touch.

= See Your True ROI =

Attribution is the only platform that pulls your cost data from ad platforms, correlates that cost to specific users, then tracks revenue from those users over time.

= Eliminate Duplicate Tracking =

Use multi-touch attribution models to accurately spread credit across ad platforms, social channels and content marketing. Get the full picture with first touch, last touch, linear and time decay attribution models.

= Tracking Any Type of Spending =

Apply any type of spending to any channel. Want to track ROI on a niche ad platform? No problem. Want to track the ROI of your social media consultants? We can do that too.

= Get Your Customer's Full Story =

Each customer tells an interesting story that you'll never get from a spreadsheet or an ad platform. Understand those stories and use them to power better marketing decisions.

= Track Real Lifetime Value =

Attribution lets you track both the revenue collected as it happens, and the revenue expected based on the account. You define your lifetime value and we track the ROI.

= Track Real People Across All Devices =

Our model is based on people, not devices, so you can seamlessly track customers across multiple devices, phones, and apps.
